# Plotly_Biodiversity

## Overview
This project contains a website created for a biological research who conducted a study on bacteria obtained from test subject's bellybuttons.
The primary goal of the website is to take the data collected and create several interactive visualizations for researchers to conceptualize.

## Results
Deliverable 1- A horizontal bar chart of the top 10 bacteria found in a selected test subject.
